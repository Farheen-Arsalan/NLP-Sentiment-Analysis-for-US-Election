# NLP Sentiment Analysis for US Election

Sentiment analysis is a technique through which we can examine a text to figure out the sentiment such as the mood or mentality it represents. This technique is performed on textual data and classifies its sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral to assist businesses in tracking consumer needs and comprehending their needs accordingly.

It is a powerful technique with significant business implications such as predicting election results. We can forecast the outcome of the U.S. election by examining the sentiment behind the significant number of tweets by the general public toward participating candidates in the U.S. election.
